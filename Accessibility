## ZenTasker Accessibility Commitment

At ZenTasker, accessibility isn’t an add-on — it’s a core design principle.

We believe that everyone, regardless of ability, cognitive style, or environment, should be able to manage their tasks, organize their work, and focus calmly. 

## What Accessibility Means to Us:
- **Built-in, never bolted on** — Accessibility is integrated from the start.
- **Inclusive design for all** — We consider visual, motor, cognitive, and neurodivergent needs in every design decision.
- **No premium paywalls** — Accessibility features are part of the core ZenTasker experience and always free.

## Our Accessibility Principles:
- Clear, high-contrast themes and color palettes.
- Fully keyboard-navigable interfaces.
- Support for switch devices and alternative input methods.
- ARIA labeling and screen reader compatibility.
- Customizable font sizes and support for dyslexia-friendly fonts.
- Text-to-speech and speech-to-text integration (Whisper).
- Optional Neurodiversity Mode with specialized adjustments for focus and processing.
- Visual simplicity to reduce cognitive load.
- Gradual task reveal features to avoid decision paralysis.
- Gentle, non-intrusive notifications and reminders.

## Continuous Commitment:
- Accessibility testing is part of every release cycle.
- Automated audits (Lighthouse, axe) and manual testing processes are in place.
- Community feedback on accessibility is always welcomed and prioritized.

> ZenTasker’s mission is to build a calm, accessible, and inclusive productivity tool for every user, everywhere.
