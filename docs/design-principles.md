## âœ¨ Our Mission
ZenTasker is built to foster calm, focus, and simplicity. Every feature, interaction, and visual choice is made to help users stay in flow without distraction.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Design Principles

### 1. **Simplicity Above All**
- Only essential elements are included by default.
- Advanced features are available through optional plugins.
- Clean, minimal UI to reduce friction and visual clutter.

### 2. **Distraction-Free by Default**
- No pop-ups, intrusive alerts, or forced nudges.
- Users stay in control of their workspace and notifications.
- Focus Mode and Gradual Reveal are key pillars.

### 3. **Optional, Intentional Power**
- Complex functionality is never forced.
- All advanced workflows (like Kanban, Eisenhower Matrix, or Time Blocking) live in optional plugins.
- Users choose what works best for them.

### 4. **Accessibility is Non-Negotiable**
- Designed for everyone: neurodivergent users, those with visual or motor impairments, and non-native language speakers.
- Accessibility features are core, not gated.
- High-contrast, font scaling, switch device support, and text-to-speech are all planned defaults.

### 5. **Consistency and Predictability**
- All UI components follow a unified design language.
- Navigation follows the two-action rule â€” no action more than two steps away.
- Consistent spacing, color palette, and micro-interactions.

### 6. **Psychology-Informed UX**
- Reduce decision fatigue through gradual reveal and clear next actions.
- Positive, gentle microcopy.
- No pressure-based or anxiety-inducing prompts.

### 7. **Personalization Without Complexity**
- File-based `settings.yaml` to allow easy export, import, and customization.
- The core remains minimal, while power users can personalize deeply.

### 8. **Visual Calm**
- Gentle animations, subtle shadows, and warm color palettes.
- No flashing, bright distractions.
- Balanced whitespace and clear hierarchy.
