## 🚀 ZenTasker — The Calm, Accessible GTD Task Manager *(Coming Soon)*

### **Why ZenTasker?**
ZenTasker will be an open-source, self-hosted task management app built around Getting Things Done (GTD) principles. It’s designed to be distraction-free, neurodiverse-friendly, and fully accessible — giving you the clarity and calm to focus on what matters.

This repository is currently under development. We are preparing to build something intentional, minimalist, and empowering.

If you’re a contributor or collaborator interested in joining from the beginning, please read the manifesto and design principles below.
