# ZenTasker Manifesto: Build Calm, Build Focus, Build Together

## **Why We Exist**
I’ve used countless commercial and open-source productivity tools. Most feel noisy, overwhelming, and disconnected from the way I — and many others — want to work. ZenTasker is born from the desire to create a tool aligned with human psychology, mindful focus, and inclusive design.

We’re building more than software. We’re building a philosophy and a community of people who believe productivity should be calm, simple, and accessible to everyone.

## **Our Core Beliefs**

### 1. Simplicity Above All
Only what matters. No clutter, no noise.

### 2. Distraction-Free by Default
Features and prompts are optional. Focus is sacred.

### 3. Optional, Intentional Power
Advanced features will live in plugins. Complexity is never forced.

### 4. Accessibility is Fundamental
Inclusive by design — never paywalled, always prioritized.

### 5. Built on Good Psychology
We reduce anxiety, respect cognitive load, and encourage calm progress.

### 6. Community with Purpose
We welcome contributors who honor these values and help others work better.

> ZenTasker is not just another app. It’s a movement toward deliberate, human-centered productivity.
