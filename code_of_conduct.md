# ZenTasker Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment
At ZenTasker, we are committed to building an open, inclusive, respectful, and collaborative community. We are respectful, open to all, and accessible by default. We believe that great tools are built on trust, diversity of thought, kindness, and universal access.

Everyone participating in the ZenTasker community — whether as a contributor, user, or collaborator — is expected to help create a safe, calm, and welcoming environment for all.

## Our Principles
- **Kindness First:** Be patient, friendly, and supportive. Assume good intent.
- **Openness:** We welcome everyone, regardless of background or experience.
- **Accessibility by Default:** Design and communication should be accessible for all, without barriers.
- **Simplicity and Clarity:** Communicate clearly and thoughtfully, reducing complexity wherever possible.
- **Respect Different Perspectives:** Diverse opinions and feedback are valued. Disagreements should be handled with empathy and professionalism.
- **No Tolerance for Harassment or Discrimination:** We do not tolerate harassment or exclusion of any kind, including but not limited to that based on race, gender, ability, neurodiversity, age, nationality, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic.
- **Focus on Calm Collaboration:** Avoid aggressive or demanding behavior. Our project culture emphasizes mindful, focused progress over urgency and stress.

## Examples of Positive Behavior
- Offering constructive feedback in a kind, respectful manner.
- Celebrating contributions, no matter how small.
- Using inclusive, welcoming language.
- Encouraging new contributors and offering guidance.
- Being open to feedback and continuous learning.

## Unacceptable Behavior Includes:
- Insulting or derogatory comments.
- Harassment or intimidation in any form.
- Dismissing or invalidating the contributions of others.
- Repeated disruptive behavior or demands.
- Violating personal boundaries.

If you witness or experience any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it confidentially to **conduct@zentasker.app**. All reports will be reviewed promptly and handled with care.

## Enforcement
- The maintainers reserve the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct.
- Contributors asked to stop unacceptable behavior are expected to comply immediately.
- Repeated or serious violations may result in temporary or permanent exclusion from the community.
